<h1 style="font-size: 40px;"><u>Making an OS using NASM and C</u></h1>
<h1>Part I : Intro</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>After looking at the os-dev wiki, I found many of the tutorials to be extremely confusing and aimless.
    and making my own operating system has always been a plan of mine. At the time of writing,
    I have very little knowledge on how to make bootloaders and kernels (which is probably why os-dev has been so confusing for me).
    And there are also very few resources online on how to make operating systems; they are either 1000-page university-level documents that
    Don’t start at boot loading and mainly focus on the theory behind processes and paging, many operating concepts that will take months of
    reading to get through, or are unfinished or small documents that do not provide enough info.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there are only a couple things online that are aimed at getting beginners started on operating system development.
    I aim to try and demystify the process of writing your own operating system in this blog without it taking up too much of your time.
    If there are any problems or things that confuse you in any of my articles, please email me about them, as I am eager to improve both my technical writing and programming.</p>

<p>Although this series of articles is aimed at beginners, I recommend making sure you know a bit about how any flavor of assembly works.
    and how C works. That’s all the required knowledge you would need to get started.</p>

<p>Another thing to say is that I intend to use my writing style to only give you the necessary points for understanding the code.
    behind a lot of the aspects behind OS development and not actually go into depth about all these types of topics, but I probably will write
    a few articles about the theory behind it all, as that is required to understand how BIOS and CPU architecture work, to start writing OS stuff.</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>My operating system will work on x86 CPUs, will be stored on a virtual floppy disk, and will be made using C and ASM.
    There will also be some other tools being used in order to make the development process a lot easier. Such as GDB,
    to debug whatever I write, Makefiles in order to build the project fast, and qemu in order to run the OS without having to reboot my system repeatedly.</p>

<h2>Getting started : What's first?</h2>

<p>The first step in making an operating system is to either set up or make a bootloader.
    I will be making one; if you wanted to set one up, you could probably set up the kernel you write with GRUB.
    In order to make a bootloader, there will only be 3 steps.</p>

<p>Step 1: printing in bios that we are booting the OS.</p>
<p>Step 2: reading the hard disk in the right place and loading the kernel into memory (in bios).</p>
<p>Step 3: giving access to the kernel, by jumping to where we loaded the kernel into memory (still in bios).</p>

<p>We also need to remember that we are programming assembly without an operating system.
    This means that we can’t use any OS interrupts in order to print to the screen, read from certain file locations,
    or anything else we would have taken for granted when doing our regular programming.</p>

<p>This is a good decomposition of the problem of writing our own bootloader; even now, you could even stop reading.
    and google how to do these steps or even ask ChatGPT, it’s good to decompose problems for a massive subject like making your own OS,
    It can help us learn about the aspects rather than being overwhelmed with information when we google “how to make a bootloader."
    We can google “how to print to bios in NASM” and “how to read from a hard disc in bios NASM.”.</p>

<p>Even printing is complex without an operating system, so don’t get hung up if you take an hour trying to do any aspect of what
    we’re doing, especially if you’re just sitting there trying to understand some instructions or code (I have done this many times).</p>

<p>In the next chapter, I will cover and go step by step with you on how to produce the bootloader using the steps I have laid out.</p>
