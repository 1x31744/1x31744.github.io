<h1 style="font-size: 40px;"><u>Making an NES emulator (diary).</u></h1>
<h1>Part I : Intro</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
    Just to note, this series will be structured like a diary, you could potentially use this for your own learning if you are also trying to make any type of emulator,
    but i will not try to go to extreme levels of detail in order to help you understand, this is mainly just to record my own learning and code of making an NES emulator, if 
    you want something to help you learn NES emulation, i reccoment a series by one lone coder on youtube. (which is also a recource i will be using)

    I hope you have fun reading my diary, thanks!
